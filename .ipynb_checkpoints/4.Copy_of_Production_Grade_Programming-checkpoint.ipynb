    "# What is Production Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Production environment is a term used mostly by developers to describe the setting where software and other products are actually put into operation for their intended uses by end users. It's an environment where our code is deployed. It is the environment of the end user.\n",
    "Rules for production environment code:\n",
    "1. Keep it modular: The idea here is to break a large code into small independent sections(functions) based on its functionality. \n",
    "2. Code Optimization: Code optimization implies both reduced time complexity (run time) as well as reduced space complexity (memory usage).\n",
    "3. Unit Testing: Your code have to clear multiple stages of testing and debugging before getting into production.\n",
    "4. Compatibility with ecosystem: Most likely, your code is not going to be a standalone function or module. It will to be integrated into company’s code ecosystem and your code has to run synchronously with other parts of the ecosystem without any flaws/failures. Ex. Compatibility of code with the data pulling tool of the end user's environment.\n",
    "5.  Readability: The code you write should be easily digestible for others as well, at least for your team mates. Moreover, it will be challenging even for you to understand your own code in few months after writing the code, if proper naming conventions are not followed. A good code has Appropriate variable and function names, Doc string and comments.\n",

    "Concepts that will be useful in writing production grade code:\n",
    "* Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "* Handling Errors and Exceptions\n"

    "# 1. Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an approach used for creating neat and reusable code instead of a redundant one. The program is divided into self-contained objects or several mini-programs. Every Individual object represents a different part of the application having its own logic and data to communicate within themselves.\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) tends to be one of the most interesting concepts to learn in Python.\n",

It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects. More specifically, any single integer or any single string is an object. The number 12 is an object, the string “Hello, world” is an object, a list is an object that can hold other objects, and so on. You’ve been using objects all along and may not even realize it. A list and a tuple exibit different behaviour.   \n",
